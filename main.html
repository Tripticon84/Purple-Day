                <h2>What is the Purple Day ?</h2>
                    <div class="text">
                        <span class="purple">Purple Day</span> is an international event that takes place on March 26th each year to raise awareness about epilepsy. This event was founded in 2008 by  a Canadian girl named Cassidy Megan, who was motivated to create a day dedicated to  epilepsy awareness after she was diagnosed with the condition at the age of seven.

                        The main goal of <span class="purple">Purple Day</span> is to dispel myths and  misunderstandings about epilepsy and encourage those living with the condition to speak  openly about it. The event is marked by people wearing purple, which is the color that   represents epilepsy awareness. People also take part in various activities such as    fundraising, educational events, and sharing their personal stories about epilepsy. <br />
                        <br />
                        Since its inception, <span class="purple">Purple Day</span> has grown into a global     movement, with people in countries around the world taking part. The event has helped to    increase public understanding of epilepsy and promote acceptance and inclusion for people  living with the condition.

            <h2>Treatments:</h2>
            Currently, there is no known cure for epilepsy, but there are various treatments available to help manage the condition. Advances in medical technology and research have led to significant improvements in the treatment of epilepsy over the years, and there is ongoing research aimed at finding new treatments and ultimately, a cure.<br />
            Some of the recent advances in epilepsy research and treatment include: <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs):</strong> There have been significant developments in the field of AEDs, with new drugs being developed that are more effective and have fewer side effects than older medications.<br />

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Responsive neurostimulation (RNS):</strong> This is a relatively new treatment approach that involves implanting a device in the brain that can detect and respond to abnormal brain activity in real-time, helping to prevent seizures before they occur.<br />

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Deep brain stimulation (DBS):</strong> This involves the implantation of electrodes in the brain that can help regulate abnormal brain activity and reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.<br />

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Gene therapy:</strong> Researchers are exploring the use of gene therapy to treat epilepsy by targeting the underlying genetic causes of the condition.<br />

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI):</strong> AI-based tools are being developed to help predict and prevent seizures, and to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment.<br />
