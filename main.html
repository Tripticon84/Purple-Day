                <div class="text">
                    Purple Day is an international event that takes place on March 26th each year to raise awareness about epilepsy. This event was founded in 2008 by a Canadian girl named Cassidy Megan, who was motivated to create a day dedicated to epilepsy awareness after she was diagnosed with the condition at the age of seven. <br />
                    <br />
                    The main goal of Purple Day is to dispel myths and misunderstandings about epilepsy and encourage those living with the condition to speak openly about it. The event is marked by people wearing purple, which is the color that represents epilepsy awareness. People also take part in various activities such as fundraising, educational events, and sharing their personal stories about epilepsy. <br />
                    <br />
                    Since its inception, Purple Day has grown into a global movement, with people in countries around the world taking part. The event has helped to increase public understanding of epilepsy and promote acceptance and inclusion for people living with the condition.
